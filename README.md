# HackRu
Inspiration a short conversation before the event got us thinking of how language connects (and divides us)
What it does it's two parts, first a program to search for the relations between words, across different scripts and alphabets, secondly, it's a web program to display that information in a thought-provoking and simple manner
How we built it java and selenium were used for the desktop portion, JavaScript and html for the web portion
Challenges we ran into while many APIs provide translation, few provide the phonetic version that can be easily compared to those using the Latin alphabet
Accomplishments that we're proud of - it's finished
What we learned how to effectively get information from websites and connect that information to the real world
What's next for Words of a nation no idea
Built With
